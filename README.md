# excemel
Create XML from Excel, based on the defined JSON structure.
## Note
The current state is far from "final" and not really stable.  
I've created this tool for a specific task but i would like to make it able to use for multiple purposes later.
## TODO
- create tests
- order: column
- same column index for multiple elemements
- multiple merge key
- constant values in struct
